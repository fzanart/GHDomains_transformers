# GitHub Domains
GitHub Domains transformer is a spin off from GHDomains repo, intended to explore new model options based on transformers models.
Automatically categorising GitHub repositories by application domain

Project Description

Aim: Develop a machine learning solution for classifying GitHub projects by their domain, based on an existing annotated dataset.
Overview

Software repository hosting sites such as GitHub are home to a wide range of software projects, from application software to libraries and frameworks. Based on an existing annotated dataset of 5,000 GitHub repositories in terms of their application domain (available at https://zenodo.org/record/804474#.YDRysugzbZu), the goal of this project is to develop an automated approach for classifying unseen GitHub.
